# Push-Video-to-Kodi-with-Alfred
Alfred Workflow to push Videos from Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and mp3/mp4 Links with Safari to Kodi


## Installation
Double-Click the workflow file to install it in Alfred. I've created one file for Safari and another for Brave Browser.

## Usage
Use CMD+k to push the focused tab to Kodi via JSON-RPC. You can also use the keyword push and paste the video-link. With the keyword que, you can add a video link to kodis queue. Clear the queue with the keyword clear.
You can customize this shortcuts/keywords in Alfred workflow options.

Have fun!
