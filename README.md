# Push-Video-to-Kodi-with-Alfred
Alfred Workflow to push Videos from Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and mp3/mp4 Links to Kodi.


## Installation
Double-Click the workflow file to install it in Alfred. I've created one file for Safari and another for Brave Browser (this only affects the keyboard-shortcut method). 

## Configuration
Before you can use this workflow, you have to insert the IP of your Kodi device into the workflows bash scripts in Alfreds workflow preferences. Just replace the IP which is given in the scripts. 
Besides you have to active "Allow control of Kodi via HTTP" on Kodi settings System > Settings > Services > Webserver

## Usage
Use CMD+k to push the focused tab to Kodi via JSON-RPC. You can also use keywords. Use "push" and paste the video-link into the Alfred Window. With the keyword "que", you can add a video link to kodis queue. Clear the queue with the keyword "clear".
You can customize this shortcuts/keywords in Alfred workflow options.

Have fun!
